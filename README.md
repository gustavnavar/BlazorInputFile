# &lt;AgnoInputFile&gt;

Version 0.3.0 has changed the component name to ```AgnoInputFile``` to avoid name collision with the new ```InputFile``` component introduced in .Net 5.0

This is a prototype for a file input component that may be added to Blazor in the future.

For installation and usage information, see [this blog post](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2019/09/13/blazor-inputfile/).
